# Unity-TANKS

## Description

TANKS is an isometric, round-based, player vs player arena battle. Each player must pilot their tanks, and attempt to destroy their opponent 
while simultaneously dealing with incoming fire, and attempting to correctly range their own shots. In TANKS, both 
players control their tanks from the same keyboard. The blue tank in the top-left is controlled by the AWSD keys, and can fire using the spacebar. 
On the other hand, the red tank in the bottom-right is controlled via the arrow keys, and may fire their main gun using the enter key.

One of the intersting features of TANKS is the dynamic camera zoom. It is constantly adjusting its zoom and position in order to keep 
both players in view at all times - an important feature when both players are controlling their avatars from a single computer. Like 
several of my other games, TANKS was also built using the Unity game engine.

## Note

Due to the sheer size of the game's source files - most of which consist largely of indecipherable Unity engine componenets and metadata - only a small portion could be included in this repository. I chose what I deemed the most relevant files to demonstrate the foundation of the game, which in this case was the Assets folder. The assets directory contains the sounds, models, materials, and scripts used to implement the game's functionality.
